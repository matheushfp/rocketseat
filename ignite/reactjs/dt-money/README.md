# DT Money

This is the third project in the React learning path from Ignite education program of Rocketseat.<br>
This is a finances app, where the user can register new transactions (income and outcome), and filter transactions by name, category, etc.<br>
In this project requests to a backend server and performance in react apps were studied. Hooks like useCallback and useMemo were used.
