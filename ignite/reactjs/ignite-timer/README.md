# Ignite Timer (Pomodoro Application)

This is the second project in the React learning path from Ignite education program of Rocketseat.<br>
This application is a Pomodoro Timer, where the user can put the name of the project he's working and the amount of minutes the timer will be running (currently the minimum time is 5 minutes and the maximum time is 60 minutes per project). <br>
The user also can access the history of projects which contains their duration, start date and status: completed, interrupted or in progress.<br>
When a new project is registered in the application, the tab name in the browser contains the timer to end the cycle and the name of the project. <br>
In this project several concepts of React were studied, like states, Context API, Reducers, etc<br>
