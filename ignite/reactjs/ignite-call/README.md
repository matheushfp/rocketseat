# Ignite Call

Check the application in: https://ignite-call-sigma-gold.vercel.app/

This is a scheduling application that allows people to login with Google and set their time availability for other people create schedulings with them via Google Calendar.<br>
In this application, several concepts were studied like Static Pages, SEO in Next.js applications, implementation of OAuth 2.0 to allow login via Google and connection to the Calendar API from Google.<br>
The purpose of this application is to create an account and send the link of your Calendar to other people, allowing them to create appointments with you.<br>
This was a long project that made me improve my skills in React and Next.js and in this project I learned how to integrate Google APIs with my application, authentication in Next.js with NextAuth, etc.<br>
