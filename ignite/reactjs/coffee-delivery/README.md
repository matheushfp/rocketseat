# Coffee Delivery

Second Challenge in the React learning path from Ignite education program of Rocketseat.<br>
This application is a coffee shop, where the user can add / remove coffees to the cart, fill the form to checkout and receive a success page indicating details from the shipping of the products.<br>
In this project several concepts from React were used, such as hooks like useState and useReducer; Context API, immutability, etc. A custom hook "useCart" was created to share the cart between the pages. The localStorage was used to store cart data. <br>
Users can't submit the form without items in the cart, and need to fill the required fields in the form. If a user tries to submit the form without filling an required field, error messages will show up warn the user about the fields he missed. <br>
The application was built to be responsive. <br>
More details of the application can be viewed in Figma: https://www.figma.com/file/5yT9ZzZmRQRS4yivGGB3pl/Coffee-Delivery/duplicate
